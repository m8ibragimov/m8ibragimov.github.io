### Personal

I am a big fan of doing sports for pleasure and sanity. I love outdoor activities like jogging, biking and tennis but also regularly go to gym. Personally, I find sports as a best way to free up my mind after work (or before) and the easiest tool to generate positive emotions.

I also like reading about ancient history (mostly ancient Rome and Greece) and learn pencil sketching. Sometimes I enjoy playing strategy computer games.
