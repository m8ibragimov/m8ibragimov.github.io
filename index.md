I am a 5th-year PhD Candidate in Management at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/). I am on an academic job market in 2022.

My research focuses on improving companies' core business strategies by utilizing machine learning, econometrics, and mathematical modeling. Currently, I am working on product returns management, personalized targeting, and product assortment optimization. I am also interested in how consumers make decisions and search for products online. 

I am fortunate to have my training supervised by [John R. Hauser](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/john-r-hauser) and [Duncan Simester](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/duncan-simester) (co-chairs) from MIT, and [Daria Dzyabura](https://sites.google.com/a/nes.ru/daria-dzyabura/) from NES.

Before starting my PhD I worked on companies' operations improvement as a consultant at [EY](https://www.ey.com/en_us). I hold a bachelors and master's in physics from [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/) and a masters in economics from [NES](https://www.nes.ru/official&lang=en).
